# Dear GitHub

This is a robot account that is used for research
and development of software design and engineering.

It is used in combination with the [lychee.js Engine](https://github.com/Artificial-Engineering/lycheejs)
inside the [Artificial-Engineering](https://github.com/Artificial-Engineering)
organization.

As the concept behind the lychee.js project uses a
world-wide botnet running ES/HyperNEAT instances,
this bot may cause many traffic for you.


If that generated traffic is too much, please contact
[@cookiengineer](https://github.com/cookiengineer)
and he will try to resolve the issue as fast as
possible. Usually he's online 24/7 but I hope you
understand that sometimes, he needs to sleep and eat
a bit.

It would be awesome if you would support the project
though! We love using GitHub and we really love
everything around it.

The bots themselves can't infringe any DMCA anyhow,
as everything is self-written, self-engineered and
self-taught by the neural networks themselves.
Copyright infringement (internationally spoken) can't
be done when machines write code as they are not
accepted as rightful people (persons) in front of
the law. That is sad and hopefully going to change
in future.

As the generated code is by far beyond human knowability,
we somehow can't influence what's going on in the `humansneednotapply`
branch of the lychee.js project. We just know that it's
by far better code than we as humans ever could write.

Let's make this world a better place and automate
software, because the people behind Artificial-Engineering
are tired of human-written code and want to get things
done faster.


Kudos from Germany,
