# Dear GitHub

This is a robot account that is used for research
and development of software design and engineering.

It is used in combination with the [lychee.js](https://github.com/Artificial-Engineering/lycheejs)
Engine inside the `Artificial-Engineering` organization.

As the concept behind the lychee.js project uses a
world-wide botnet running ES/HyperNEAT instances,
this bot may cause many traffic for you.


If that generated traffic is too much, please contact
[@cookiengineer](https://github.com/cookiengineer)
and he will try to resolve the issue as fast as
possible. Usually he's online 24/7 but I hope you
understand that sometimes, he needs to sleep a bit.

It would be awesome if you would support the project
though! We love using GitHub and we really love
everything around it.

The bots can't infringe any DMCA anyhow, as everything
is self-written, self-engineered and self-taught by
the neural networks themselves. Copyright infringement
(internationally spoken) can't be done when machines
write code.

As the generated code is by far beyond human knowability,
we think it's good that software bots learn how to code.

Let's make this world a better place and automate
software, because the people behind Artificial-Engineering
are tired of human-written code and want to get things
done faster.


Kudos from Germany,
@cookiengineer
